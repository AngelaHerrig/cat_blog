        <h1>What is normal cat behaviour?</h1>

        <img class="posts-imgs"src="./IMG/post-2_index.jpg" alt="cat">

        <p>The cat has a subtle repertoire of facial expressions, vocal sounds, and tail and body postures that express
            its emotional state and intentions. These various signals serve to increase, decrease, or maintain social
            distance. One distinctive social behaviour involves rubbing the side of the head, lips, chin, or tail
            against the owner and against furniture. These regions of the cat’s body contain scent glands that seem to
            play a role in establishing a familiar odour in the cat’s environment.</p>

    <div class="overview">
        <h1>What should I feed my cat?</h1>
        <img class="posts-imgs"src="./IMG/post-3_index.jpg" alt="cat eating">
        <p>Cats should have a diet similar to that of their wild relatives. They are adapted by nature to be flesh
            eaters, as is shown by their alimentary tract and their dentition. The cat uses its canines to catch and
            kill prey, the molars to cut it up. Lack of flat-surfaced teeth prevents it from chewing or gnawing. The cat
            has a short intestine, and its stomach secretes digestive juices that act primarily on meat. Cats, however,
            like all meat-eating animals, ingest grass and other plants occasionally, and small quantities of vegetables
            may serve as both a laxative and a hair ball remover.
